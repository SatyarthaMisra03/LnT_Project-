# Cloud_Inventory_Updation-
Cloud-Based Inventory Portal

This project, created as part of our coursework at Shri Ramswaroop Memorial University, it addresses the inefficiencies of manual inventory tracking. Traditional methods—like emailing Excel files back and forth—lead to version conflicts and data loss. To solve this, We built a lightweight, cloud-native Asset Management Portal. 

By taking Advantage of Google Sheets as a database and a custom JavaScript frontend, this tool allows multiple users to add, track, and export asset data simultaneously without needing a dedicated server setup. "It demonstrates the power of serverless architecture in solving everyday operational challenges".
